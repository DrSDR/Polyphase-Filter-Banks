attached is a matlab file that creates a WB IQ file.
the matlab script reads in N audio files  (in the audio directory, please only have Odd number of audio files only)
then creates a polyphase WB signal, with each audio file as a AM radio signal.
this iq file can be streamed to a sdr device for RF transmission.
see Thegmr140  youtube channel for more info and a demo of this matlab file.
